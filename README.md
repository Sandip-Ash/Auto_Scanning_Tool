# Auto_Scanning_Tool
Auto Scanning Tool is a menu driven program made with Bash Scripting. It is used for enumeration/scanning a target using it's IPv4 address (like 142.251.42.46) or 
domain name (like google.com). It includes different types of scanning options. This tool is based on nmap scans. People feels hectic to remember commands, so I have made it
to release their burden. I will be thankful if anybody contributes in this project.
